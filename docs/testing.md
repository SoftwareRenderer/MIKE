# Testing Conventions & Mock LLM

Read this when writing or debugging e2e/unit tests. The commands, the test-server table and the
stale-state cleanup stay in `AGENTS.md → Testing`.

## E2E conventions
- Descriptive spec filenames in `frontend/tests/e2e/`; shared helpers in `helpers.ts`.
- `test.describe.serial()` when tests share state; unique identifiers (`Date.now()`) to avoid
  interference; wait for selectors, no arbitrary delays (drag-and-drop is the known exception —
  headless is slow).
- **Mock LLM is default** — tests use pre-recorded fixtures, never the real endpoint. Fail gracefully
  when the LLM is slow/unavailable.
- **Config-modifying tests** (settings, models, shortcuts, mode select, …) must run in the `isolated`
  project — add them to `testMatch` in `playwright.config.ts`.
- **Heavy fixtures get a dedicated repo** — specs that create large files or mutate the working tree
  must NOT write into the shared `/tmp/kanban-test-repo` (other specs' `git add -A && git commit`
  races with them). Init a dedicated repo (e.g. `/tmp/kanban-test-repo-<name>`), create its project
  in `beforeAll` (use `browser.newContext({ storageState })` — `page` is not available in
  `beforeAll`), delete both in `afterAll`, and wrap the describe in `.serial`. See
  `editor-wrap-highlight.spec.ts`.
- global-setup sets a **local git identity** on the test repos — don't remove it: backend
  commit-and-done commits don't pass `-c` author flags, and without it those e2e tests fail silently
  (commit skipped, task still moves to Done).

## Mock LLM server

`frontend/tests/mock-llm.js` (Node, port 9999). Selects a fixture by request body (tools present +
message keywords). Fixtures: `frontend/tests/fixtures/` — JSON arrays of OpenAI streaming SSE chunks.

Disable: `MIKE_USE_MOCK_LLM=0 npx playwright test` (real LLM endpoint).

Fixture format — one entry per SSE `data:` frame:

```json
{"choices": [{"delta": {"content": "Hello"}, "finish_reason": null}]}
```

Tool calls use `delta.tool_calls` with `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`; the final frame has
`finish_reason: "stop"` plus `usage` (incl. `prompt_ms`/`predicted_ms`).

**Recording a new fixture:** run with `MIKE_USE_MOCK_LLM=0`, capture the real SSE stream (browser
DevTools Network tab or server logs), save it as a JSON array in `frontend/tests/fixtures/`, and add
keyword routing in `mock-llm.js` if needed.

## Diagnostic scripts (ad-hoc investigation)

For request-pattern/race investigation, write standalone Playwright scripts in `frontend/tests/` as
`.mjs` files run against a live dev server: `make run` then `node frontend/tests/<script>.mjs`. Use
`page.evaluate()` for API calls (CSRF token from `/api/auth/session` for POST/PUT/DELETE),
`route.fetch()` + `route.fulfill()` for interception, `Date.now()` offsets for timing, and
`page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/debug.png' })`.

## E2E failure patterns

- **`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`** / wrong-protocol response: stale processes from an interrupted run hold
  the ports — run the cleanup block in `AGENTS.md → Testing → Test Environment`.
- **`waiting for locator('.project-item')`**: test project not created — check global-setup logs.
  **`waiting for locator('.card')`**: no tasks exist.
- **Drag-and-drop flakes:** headless is slow — add `waitForTimeout` after the drag, increase the
  predicate timeout.
- **Mock LLM routing wrong:** check keyword matching in `mock-llm.js` and the fixture files.
